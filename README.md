# XML-RPC for Java ME
kXML-RPC is a Java ME (J2ME) implementation of the XML-RPC protocol built on top of the kXML parser. kXML-RPC empowers Java ME devices with a lightweight mechanism for exchanging data and invoking web services, in a neutral, standardized XML format. This library was originally developed against the Sun Java Wireless Toolkit and CLDC/MIDP.
